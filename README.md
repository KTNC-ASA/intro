# intro
Introduction to KTNC's GitHub

The team behind KTNC has some lion-sized goals. We aim not only to improve the utility and usefulness of the token, but to push Algorand forward as we share code and information about our smart contracts, marketplaces and applications.

KTNC will build resources to support and promote interaction with our community, to strengthen trust, and to provide utility to the greater Algorand ecosystem. Many of our planned systems will be of use to $KTNC holders, but there will be obvious use-cases for other ASAs which we plan to make available. 

We think KittenCoinâ€™s friendly and fun brand allows us to be uniquely experimental, push the envelope, and have fun while we discover and unlock the power of the Algorand blockchain.
