# Introduction to KTNC's GitHub
_WORKING DRAFT_

The KTNC community has some lion-sized goals. We aim not only to improve the utility and usefulness of the token, but to push Algorand forward as we share code and information about our smart contracts, marketplaces and applications. 

In addition to our community objectives, the KTNC Learn team aims to build EdTech solutions, such as blockchain curriculum and administrative solutions using the Algorand blockchain. We’ll have more to share about our KTNC Learn products in 2022.

KittenCoin Community developers will build resources to support and promote interaction with our community, to strengthen trust, and to provide utility to the greater Algorand ecosystem. Many of our planned systems will be of use to $KTNC holders, but there will be obvious use-cases for other ASAs which we plan to make available. 

We think KittenCoin’s friendly and fun brand allows us to be uniquely experimental, push the envelope, and have fun while we discover and unlock the power of the Algorand blockchain. We invite you to review our technical roadmap. 

**Recruitment**
**Interested in joining our team? Please reach out to us directly at recruiting@kittencoin-asa.net**

+ Lead devs (dedicated weekly commitments, long term compensation plans possible, bounties) 
+ Junior devs (sportatic “sprint” or “project” commitments, bounty eligible)
+ Volunteer/Learner devs (access to the resources, low commitment level)

KittenCoin is a community coin, and while we have a main development team consisting of lead and junior devs, there are always opportunities for volunteers and community members to take on projects that pique their interest. Our dev team and cross-token development community is there to assist novice, volunteer, and other casual developers pursue projects that can be used by the KTNC community. If an interest aligns with our goals, we may even support a bounty program.

**Short and long term goals**
Or goals can be divided in to short term “features” that will add immediate and obvious value to the token, or to the community generally, and long term initiatives, or “epics” that will work to align the token to use-cases that support the primary goals of the KTNC Community — education, charity, and artist development
